	\textbf{\Large Acknowledgement}\\\\
I would like to express my deep gratitude to my supervisor Prof$.$ Dr$.$ Andreas Mauthe and Mr$.$ Alexander Rosenbaum for accepting the proposed master thesis topic and providing invaluable assistance throughout the project. \\
Without my mother's encouragement and support, I would not have been able to finish this endeavour. My wife has been patiently caring for daughter on her own and motivating me throughout this process. \\
I would like to express my gratitude to my beloved father, who passed away during the course. Without him, I couldn't have imagined coming here to a new country and writing the final words of my master's thesis. During this period, your memories and lessons inspired me and will always be with me. \\
Finally, I would like to thank all my friends who helped me by providing suggestions, discussions, feedback, and support.
