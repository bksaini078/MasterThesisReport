	\textbf{\Large Acknowledgement}\\\\
I would like to express my deep gratitude to my supervisor Prof$.$ Dr$.$ Andreas Mauthe and Mr$.$ Alexander Rosenbaum for accepting the proposed master thesis topic and providing invaluable assistance throughout the project. \\
Without my mother's encouragement and support, I would not have been able to finish this endeavour. My wife has been patiently caring for daughter on her own and motivating me throughout this process. \\
I would like to express my gratitude to my beloved father. Without him, I couldn't have imagined coming here to a new country and writing the final words of my master's thesis. During this period, your memories and lessons inspired me, and will always be with me. \\
In last, I like to thank all the friends who helped me during this time.
