	\textbf{\Large Acknowledgement}\\\\
%I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisors Prof$.$ Dr$.$ Andreas Mauthe and Mr$.$ Alexander Rosenbaum for accepting the proposed master thesis topic and provided invaluable assistance throughout the project. \\
%Without my mother's and wife's encouragement and support, I would not have been able to finish this endeavour. I am grateful to my wife for patiently caring for our daughter on her own. \\
%Finally, I'd want to express my gratitude to my beloved father, who passed away during the course. Without him, I couldn't have imagined coming here in a new country and writing the final words of my master's thesis. Your priceless memories and lessons inspired me during this period and will always be with me. \\
